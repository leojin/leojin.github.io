Now it's time to say goodbye to WordPress. I have bought a virtual machine for several years on Tencent Cloud(1Core/1G/1Mbps). It's totally enough for my site with no comments. So, Since there's no comment, why do I need a vm to host a dynamic site? 

`ðŸ˜”What I need is just a static page.ðŸ˜”`

Here are several tools I used to make this change:

| Tools | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
